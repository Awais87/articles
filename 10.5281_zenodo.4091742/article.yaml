abstract: "This article reports on the largely successful reproduction of the author's decade-old conference paper. The original 2010 paper demonstrated that character recognition performance could be improved on difficult problems of scene text recognition by leveraging font-specific correlations between character identity and width. The work relied on a sizeable array of languages, tools, and libraries. The computation proceeded in three major phases: data synthesis, training statistical models on artificial image data and actual text data, and finally fine-tuning and running a parser with the trained models applied to the test images. Using the learned models stored from the original paper's experiments, the original parser code successfully reproduced the results exactly. The training code required minor changes to run with current host environments and libraries. Although the updated experimental results are not identical, they follow the same general trends, indicating a successfully repeated experiment."
